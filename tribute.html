          <h2>Bhagat Singh Third</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Bhagat Singh</b> was a charismatic Indian revolutionary[6] who participated in the mistaken
            murder of a junior British police officer[7] in what was to be retaliation for the death of
            an Indian nationalist.[8] He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly
            in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned 
            him into a household name in Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in N
            orthern India.[9] Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism,[10][11][12][13][14] he electrified a 
            growing militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection within the
            Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for India's independence
